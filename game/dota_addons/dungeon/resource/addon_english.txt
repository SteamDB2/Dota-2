		"chef_journal_02"	"Last year I thought my wyvern filets would have been enough to earn my pin, but only one new member is admitted each year and I underestimated my competition... never in my wildest dreams did I expect someone to prepare a wheel of Roshan cheese."
		
		//traps
		"chef_journal_03"	"This year though, I have a secret weapon... a trunk of seasoning from The Isle of Masks.  If I find the right dish to pair these lost spices with, my membership is all but assured."
		
		//ogre ridge
		"chef_journal_04"	"My expedition to the Howling Weald has so far been a failure.  The conflict between the Bonemeal Ogres and Lucius Longclaw scared away most of the wildlife save for the hellbears... but perhaps that is enough to work with."
		
		//Town
		"chef_journal_05"	"It seems dire wolves are too gamey to be used for elevated cuisine, but the quills are perfect to be fashioned into skewers for whatever protein will be featured."
		
		//Silkmire
		"chef_journal_06"	"Silkmire spider eggs are pleasingly tart.  However, based on the amount of vomiting I did after eating some, I think it’s best that I abandon dreams of using these to make a dessert."		
		"chef_journal_07"	"With Silkmire behind me I turn to a temple long since forgotten.  Perhaps a rare truffle waits to be found in a dead king's tomb, or maybe the poison from an old dart trap could be diluted and used in broth."
		
		//Desert Start
		"chef_journal_08"	"The temple did not prove as fertile as I had hoped.  Stone bats, while a viable option for a kitschy pestle, are not particularly edible."
		
		//Desert Expanse
		"chef_journal_09"	"For three days I tracked a thunderhide alpha, but it was all for naught - a Marrowfell hunting party all had eyes on the great beast... and I know better than to quibble over poaching rights with a pack of angry centaurs."		
		"chef_journal_10"	"Again I have been met with failure.  With time running short before the competition, I must dig deep and find a new solution:  Time to break out the wine."
		
		//Desert Stronghold
		"chef_journal_11"	"Kalabor is a waste of what little time remains. If land is bearing no fruit, I must turn to the seas.  If I can't find a worthy protein in the black waters surrounding Dark Reef, can I even call myself a gastromancer?"
		
		
		// Act 2
		"chef_journal_12"	"It would appear that I have stumbled upon some primitive tribe.  I thought of trying to barter for some local spices, but as I approached their camp I saw them feasting on the corpse of a fur trader.  The sooner I can find shelter the better."
		
		"chef_journal_13"	"I did not find shelter so much as shelter found me - the tribe I had previously wrote about spotted me and gave chase... were it not for a local's intervention I would certainly be dead.  On the bright side, in addition to saving me, Ymir also told me where I can find some Ogre Seals."
		
		"chef_journal_14"	"Ahh the Frostwise Penguin... while some of my contemporaries swear that their eyes are a delicacy that every man should try once in their lives, I can't bring myself to kill a waddling creature of such majesty."
		
		"chef_journal_15"	"Brutal.  Dangerous.  And utterly delicious, the Ogre Seal is the perfect protein for my play on a fish taco.  Now to find a decent town and get some proper seasoning."
		
		"chef_journal_16"	"Unlike my feelings on Penguins, I had no qualms with striking down that Alpine Growler.  By grinding his fangs to meal, perhaps I could create a soft shell that will serve as a perfect vehicle for my main protein."
		
		"chef_journal_17"	"Success!  I tested out my dish with some local performers, and they were so delighted that they invited me to hit the town with them.  After all I have been through, a proper celebration is a welcome end to my journey.  My membership within the White Orchids is all but assured."
		
		"chef_journal_18"	"I have failed in spectacular fashion.  I spent so much focus on preparing a dish worthy of heroes, that I neglected to notice the binding on my journal has been torn.  With no record of how I arrived to my final plating, the White Orchids will never accept me into their Order. So close to my final presentation, there's no way to backtrack in time to find all the missing pages... So now I sit - a half-frozen fool with a fishing pole.  I've heard this lake has pike...  I hate deboning pike."
